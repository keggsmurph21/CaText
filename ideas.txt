bad graphics:
  - card on middle of screen, flips over to reveal what the player stole
  - better handling of loading/saving
  - better handling of msgs/pMsgs (maybe have one system w/ different priorities)
  - need to have reserved names for players/saves to avoid errors
  - need system logs and game-specific logs
